## Highlights
- Maximize Impact by Manipulating Force and Time
  Summary:
  Effective communication hinges on the principle of maximizing force while minimizing the time taken for that force to have an impact.
  This involves choosing powerful, emotionally resonant words and delivering them swiftly to capture attention and convey messages succinctly. It draws an analogy to physical impact, where societies, much like structures in earthquakes, are built to absorb and manage impacts, indicating a strategic approach to communication is essential for making a lasting impression.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's high force, low time, and if you are a Matthew kind of person, you could say it's i equals f over t, which means that if this is what we're going for, we're constantly going to be thinking About two things, which is how can I increase the amount of force available to me, and how can I decrease the amount of time it takes for that force to be effective. So if I want to have an impact on this podcast, what I'll be thinking is, what are the most vivid, powerful, emotionally laden words, as well as analytically powerful words, and how quickly Can I deliver them like we're already 11 minutes in, according to my little timer here? And have I had an impact? It really requires me to think how quickly can I get my point across, right? So it's force over time, large force, small time.
  Speaker 2
  And it's the metaphor has a certain violent quality to it.
  Speaker 1
  Absolutely. You go to the dentist for an impacted wisdom to this, like it's not good news most of the time. And I've been thinking about this for a long time. I think I wrote about it first in my book Culture Making. So that was 15 years ago. Because another interesting thing is human societies are actually designed to absorb, deflect, and dissipate impact. So this happens most kind of vividly in earthquakes, because [Time 0:10:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7762ed22-1fcf-4381-b939-8adaafca30dd) [[2024-08-08]]

- Culture Resists Change to Protect Itself
  Summary:
  Cultures are resilient structures designed to defend against external impacts, whether from natural disasters or foreign invasions.
  The term 'impact the culture' reflects a desire to impose sudden changes, which may inadvertently strengthen a culture's resistance, akin to raising its immune system. It is important to critically examine the appropriateness of this metaphor, considering how cultures fundamentally aim to preserve themselves in the face of challenges.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They mobilize amazingly powerfully, you might say, to repair the damage done. So I first started thinking about this word, because it was so common for evangelical Christians in particular to be talking about, we want to impact the culture. This is by the way, turning it into a verb, which bothers me as a writer of English. But that ship has sailed. So we want to impact the culture. And I think you need to reckon with the fact that there's a school of sociology, I'm thinking of Berger and Luckman's school, that would actually say the whole reason we build culture Is to protect ourselves from the impacts that come upon us from the wider world, whether it's natural disasters or invasions from foreign forces or whatever. And societies are actually built to resist this. So if you come to the culture saying, we're here to impact you, they call Tia Leoni, which was the movie Deep Impact, and say, do you deflect that asteroid, like prevent that from happening? You actually raise the immune system of a culture when you say we're here to make a very sudden violent change. So for a long time, I've wondered, is this really the right metaphor?
  Speaker 2
  Well, also, let's speak, it's not just culture in a broad diffuse sense, it is [Time 0:12:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b6269e3e-5d6a-449e-a407-e826bc6a74d4) [[2024-08-08]]

- Harnessing Power: The Triad of Influence
  Summary:
  Coercive power, primarily held by the state, compels individuals to act against their personal will, often through threats or force.
  Financial power similarly commands attention and influence, as demonstrated by significant donations affecting public systems, such as the Chan Zuckerberg initiative impacting the New York school system. Furthermore, the power of charisma through media platforms, particularly short-form video content like TikTok, enables individuals to transcend traditional systems of authority and finance, making them formidable influencers.
  This charismatic presence on media can create massive impact without reliance on state or financial systems, highlighting a contemporary shift in how influence is wielded in society.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So if you can get hold of coercive power, the power that makes other people do something they would not do on their own, and maybe would rather not do, and that pretty much in liberal democratic Societies belongs to the state. The state can make you do stuff that you don't want to do at the threat of violence if necessary. So the power of the state, of course, then there's the power of money. If you have a lot of money, I mean, interestingly, in school systems, it's maybe 10 or 15 years ago, the Chan Zuckerberg family and foundation said to the New York school system, like, The checkbook is open, I forget the exact amount, but it was an extraordinary amount of money. I was at $100 million, I'm afraid I don't remember the show notes will correct me, but it was an extraordinary amount of money for the New York New Jersey school system. And you know, you come in with enough money and systems pay attention, right? And then I think there's a third route to really truly massive amounts of force in our world, and it's basically the power of charisma over media. So if you are good at today, vertical, short videos, TikTok, basically, or if you're that kind of face and personality that just can compel people on media, you can actually bypass the Systems of the state and even to some, and you can get all the money you need. But it's actually, in some ways, the most powerful form of impact in our world right now is just people who come out of nowhere because they're so charismatic that they just own the camera And they own the screen.

- Power Shapes Legacy
  Summary:
  The desire for concentrated power can lead to significant and rapid influence, as seen in the legacy of Augustus, who enjoyed a long reign that allowed him to establish profound societal changes, evidenced by widespread recognition and veneration during his lifetime.
  Conversely, the lack of coercive power, resources, or charisma can limit one's impact, as demonstrated by Jesus of Nazareth, who operated without such means and ultimately faced the authority's repercussions. The distinction between having and lacking these powers highlights the complexities of influence within historical and institutional contexts.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I actually think the Romans were the first in the history of the West to want this, to want this kind of power. And to see it play out in the life of a single person, Augustus born Octavian was lucky. He reigned for many decades. Most emperors weren't quite so lucky after him. But still, in a single lifetime, by the time he's 50 years old, people across the Mediterranean are erecting like statues and plaques for his birthday saying the birthday of the God Augustus was the beginning of the good news for the whole world because of the peace, you know, the Pax Romano or the Paxagasana that he had brought. And the Romans were able to concentrate power enough to have a massive impact over a short amount of time, right? Massive force over short amount of time. And if you can get access to those things, you can have an impact. But your friends are discovering like even in a small scale, relatively small scale institution, like a given school system, having enough coercive power available to you, having Finding enough money, it takes a lot of money, or having enough charisma. Most of us don't have that. And the flip side of this is these three things were the three things Jesus of Nazareth did not have. He did not have access to state coercive power. In fact, he was acted on by state coercive power in the crucifixion. [Time 0:18:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/733bc591-1a51-43a0-9db5-d369e2d60a32) [[2024-08-08]]

- Love is the Root of Faith
  Summary:
  A fulfilling relationship with the divine stems from a deep-rooted love for the teachings and ways of God, rather than mere memorization or enforcement of laws.
  This love is characterized by joy and meditation, reflecting an inner delight in spiritual practice. The connection to the Hebrew Bible, particularly the book of Ruth, emphasizes the significance of friendship and loving relationships in understanding faith and spirituality.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Like what is it about the person who is like a tree planted by streams of water, bearing fruit and dew season? That person loves the law of the Lord. So this is not a sentimental love. It's not just affection because this is a person who's who's just deeping himself or herself in attention to and love of the way of Yahweh. So this is a robust kind of love, but it is ultimately love. It's not the person who memorizes the law of the Lord, who takes down the Lord, or who imposes the law of the Lord. It's the person who delights in the love of the Lord and meditates on it. So love is the thing. Now, as I've cast about in a way for like what's our orienting story here, if it's not forced over time, like massive or small amount of time, I've been drawn more and more to the book of The Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament, that is literally named friend, except that we don't translate proper names, we just transliterate them. And so we just translate the Hebrew word for friend into the name of this book. And so we all know it as the book of Ruth, because Ruth is just the Hebrew word for friend. I did not know that.
  Speaker 2
  Is that right? That it's just that's what it is. [Time 0:41:41](https://share.snipd.com/snip/d06d0c0b-fed3-4e47-964f-c056edd29f6a) [[2024-08-12]]

- Faithful Friendship Guides Integrity
  Summary:
  Long-standing friendships provide a vital support system that upholds personal integrity and faithfulness to core values.
  In the face of temptations such as fame, coercive force, and external pressures, the accountability to close friends helps individuals resist the allure of compromise. The ability to maintain a clear conscience and authenticity, especially when confronted with societal idols, stems from the deep connections formed over time.
  True friendship fosters resilience against unethical influences, reinforcing commitment to one's principles and faith.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And David French had this comment, which relates this whole Eric Metaxas and Josh Holly question. And the question came up, you know, what what sustains want to keep faithful and not go fall for the idolatries of coercive force and money and charisma and so forth. And he said, and he turned and he looked at Tom Walsh, who's now another leader in the Trinity Forum, who is with David and me, part of the fantasy baseball league, the group of friends For 30 years. And David said, look, how could I I couldn't look Tom in the face if I went and compromised all these principles, if I went for the quick fame and did its for instance, by going after Trump Or by by going woke and trying to court, you know, sort of fame and favor and in a different political stripe. And he said, I if I Tom would know that I was doing that. And I couldn't look at Tom in the face anymore. And and look at him in the eyes or Curtis. And so there's a way in which friendship over time, to suppose sustains the outward influence we might have in the world that's just, but also stains each other in terms of our fidelity And faithfulness to God versus the idols.
  Speaker 1
  Well, you know, I have two thoughts or maybe three, actually. [Time 0:53:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e6fd638b-8248-4cf4-9c4d-453baa364545) [[2024-08-13]]

- Friendship Endures Through Betrayal and Failure
  Summary:
  Jesus exemplifies the essence of friendship by maintaining connections with both Peter and Judas, even amidst betrayal and failure.
  This demonstrates the importance of witnessing each other's shortcomings without severing ties, offering opportunities for restoration and support. Additionally, a realistic perspective on long-term commitment is necessary, emphasizing that genuine relationships and meaningful endeavors often require a dedication spanning multiple generations, especially in the absence of external resources or power.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, you know, I have two thoughts or maybe three, actually. It's really interesting how Jesus treats Peter and Judas as friends. You know, friend, why have you come as what he says to Judas? Like, so talk about looking someone in the eye who even in a moment of betrayal, but then also Peter, you know, there's this moment where Jesus looks at Peter, like, Jesus maintains relationship Even when they're actually failing him. Yeah. So that just struck me as you as you recounted, kind of David saying, what would you know, how would my friends look at me? Or how would I look at my friends? Well, like, we have to be willing to be friends enough that we see each other fail. And in the case of Peter, call them back, you know, to restoration. You know, the other thought I have is do not we need to be very realistic and not underestimate how much time we're talking about here. We're talking about three generations minimum, I think. I think the minimum value of that small t f to the t is three generations. Like, this is you are truly, if you're serious about what you're doing, given that you do not have the state power, the massive nuts money, the [Time 0:54:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1e07ee12-da59-44a1-b761-11253019d529) [[2024-08-13]]

- Embrace Failure for Lasting Impact
  Summary:
  Building meaningful connections requires a willingness to witness each other's failures and facilitate restoration.
  Achieving significant impact demands a long-term commitment, often spanning multiple generations, especially when lacking state power and substantial financial resources. The true measure of impact is often elusive, even for those in prominent positions, as real change cannot be expected within a single lifetime.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah. So that just struck me as you as you recounted, kind of David saying, what would you know, how would my friends look at me? Or how would I look at my friends? Well, like, we have to be willing to be friends enough that we see each other fail. And in the case of Peter, call them back, you know, to restoration. You know, the other thought I have is do not we need to be very realistic and not underestimate how much time we're talking about here. We're talking about three generations minimum, I think. I think the minimum value of that small t f to the t is three generations. Like, this is you are truly, if you're serious about what you're doing, given that you do not have the state power, the massive nuts money, the charisma, and, you know, make no mistake, However many of you've you've, how much money you've raised or will raise, it's like nothing compared to what you'd need for impact money. That's right. That's right. And who cares, you know, you can be a columnist in the New York Times, ask any columnist in New York Times whether they're having an impact. And if they're even slightly self reflective, they'll be like, I don't think I actually know.
  Speaker 2
  I think they're actually all deeply like to stir up. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So like you, this is, this will not be done in our lifetimes. That's right. [Time 0:55:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/edcc9e47-f4a3-42f3-bacf-4ebefad7f9cf) [[2024-08-13]]

- Faithfulness in the Face of Despair
  Summary:
  Bethlehem, often recognized as the birthplace of Jesus, holds a darker historical reference tied to violence and exploitation.
  The mention of Bethlehem evokes a sense of danger and marginalization, reflecting its troubled past, particularly during the events of the Book of Judges. In drawing parallels to contemporary places like Washington, D.C., it suggests that faithfulness amidst adversity is essential for transformation.
  Despite the feelings of despair and insignificance that individuals may experience, the narrative emphasizes that positive change is possible through persistent faithfulness and dedication over generations, even in locations deemed undesirable.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  It's the birthplace of Jesus, a little town of Bethlehem, you know, it's pretty familiar to us. But at the time, the only reference for Bethlehem is that it's the town that the concubine comes from whose rape and murder leads to the civil war that is the final like cataclysm of the Book of Judges, the Bethlehemite. And so for Ruth and Naomi to say, we're going back to Bethlehem is like to name the most like dangerous, marginal, unpleasant, it's so unpleasant even to bring it up that name. And that's where they go. So I'm not saying you shouldn't have done the event at the NDC because this is, you know, you've been given an opportunity and you should do it. But I worry in a way that someone would be listening to this and think, well, I can't ever get on this stage at the National Press Club. If if Curtis and David and Russell are feeling like despairing and small, how much more do I feel wherever I live? But Bethlehem becomes Bethlehem because of the faithfulness that starts there. Not because it's the center of the universe or the center of empire. So, you know, I think the way to think about DC is a small town that is actually like Bethlehem a byword for exploitation right now. Most Americans to some extent think, uh, icky yuck. And it's going to be has said faithfulness here over generations that will repair whatever God would graciously allow to be repaired in our world, which I want to recast.

- Trust in Divine Impact, Not Human Force
  Summary:
  Impact, especially in a spiritual context, is characterized by both monumental events and subtle, gradual changes, akin to the mustard seed phenomenon.
  While significant biblical events like the deliverance of Israel and the resurrection of Jesus exemplify powerful divine intervention, humans should not attempt to wield similar levels of force, as this often results in violence and harm. True impact can only be executed by a higher power.
  Although prayer for revival and dramatic transformations is essential, it is crucial to recognize that humans are not the architects of such impactful moments.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And the impact, you know, I feel like I should say a word on behalf of impact because we, you know, if you're Christian, you believe the, the Old Testament hinges on the sudden powerful Deliverance of Israel from slavery in Egypt and the New Testament hinges on the delivery of the buried body of Jesus from the tomb. I mean, these are massive impact events, though not culturally in the sense that they didn't, they didn't just instantly change the world. They also have a mustard seed effect, or mustard seed quality. But the thing about impact is I think only God can be trusted with that level of force. If I can put it that way. In other words, for us to try to have divine levels of force, which is what Augustus Caesar did dreaded have, is we will do violence at more violence and more harm than any good. Whereas when God, you know, when God knocks Saul of Tarsus of his horse, which is an impact moment in Saul of Tarsus' life, God is so for Saul who becomes Paul that he can do that in an appropriate Way. So it's not that we don't pray for, we pray for revival, right, of dramatic in, in breakings of God in the human story. But we are not the architects of impact.

- Trust Divine Timing for Impact
  Summary:
  Significant impact events, as seen in biblical history, demonstrate both immediate and gradual effects.
  While divine occurrences showcase the power of transformative moments, humans should not aspire to wield such force. Attempting to replicate divine levels of impact often leads to harm rather than good.
  The responsibility lies in fostering faithfulness, strong relationships, and consistent actions over time, while trusting that God will intervene in history at the appropriate moments with dramatic changes.
