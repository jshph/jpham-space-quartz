In a click-driven world, we must prioritize content that resonates on a human level. ![[Words Are My Matter by Ursula K. Le Guin Highlights#^rw783049635]]

Generative AI, while capable of expanding creative horizons, frequently results in bland uniformity. Over-reliance on algorithms risks misinformation and diminishes our understanding of the technology we wield. Instead, technology should amplify our creativity and foster deeper connections among us, rather than merely enhancing efficiency. ![[spc - scott belsky#^yu73ix]]![[spc - scott belsky#^a5todn]]

Furthermore, technology has the potential to dismantle barriers and cultivate creative communities. In our digital landscape, we yearn for meaningful interactions that inspire and challenge us. This longing for connection is mirrored in music, where shared experiences outweigh mere consumption. Streaming platforms must facilitate audience discovery, highlighting the necessity for technology to nurture authentic human experiences. ![[bespoke#^ycqgwk]]![[finding audience]] ![[takeaways from generative now episode with sarah beykpour#^tuynq3]]
